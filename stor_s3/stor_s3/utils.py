    Determine whether we have permission to write to path.

    Behavior of this method is slightly different for different storage types when the
    directory doesn't exist:
    1. For local file systems, this function will return True if the target directory
       exists and a file written to it.
    2. For AWS S3, this function will return True only if the target bucket is already
       present and we have write access to the bucket.
    3. For Swift, this function will return True, only if the target tenant is already
       present and we have write access to the tenant and container. The container doesn't
       have to be present.

    This is function is useful, because `stor.stat()` will succeed if we have read-only
    permissions to `path`, but the eventual attempt to upload will fail.

    Secondly, `path` might not exist yet. If the intent of the caller is to create it, ,
    stor.stat() will fail, however the eventual upload attempt would succeed.

    Args:
        path (stor.Path|str): The path to check.
        swift_retry_options (dict): Optional retry arguments to use for swift
            upload or download. View the
            `swift module-level documentation <swiftretry>` for more
            information on retry arguments. If the goal is to not use
            exponential backoff, pass ``{'num_retries': 0}`` here.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether ``path`` is writeable or not.
